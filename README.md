#Background:
I was assigned a task to develop a User and Group Management tool. There weren't any guidelines and restrictions associated to this task and could be developed as per developer's will. I wanted to showcase my creativity which is my USP and thus an application of this nature was developed. 

My focus as always was to develop a data-driven, functional application. Since there was a deadline of 4 hrs, the code has its share of flaws but they exists intentionally to meet this deadline. Given an opportunity to walk-through my code I could point them out and also describe future developments for this tool.  

#Instructions:

After pulling code from github execute following commands: 

    npm install
    npm start

##Functionality:
1. You may click on 'view1' to see a Map which consists of marker to mark location of random generated users.
2. On clicking these User Markers a context Menu appears showing details of users and the groups they are part of.
3. Clicking on the red box switches between the listing of groups that the user is a member of and those the user is not a member.
4. Clicking on 'add' seen in listing under 'Groups: Not part of', adds the group to user's list and which can be seen on 'Groups: Part of'

###Afterthought:
> Map based tool could be created to track market reach through media campaigns. It would be catchy and helpful in pitching business to customers.
